# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

For a production build, use:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

To preview the production build locally, use:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

This will start a local server to serve the built files.
